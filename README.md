# shaun-cv
I want to creat a template for the manager using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is my CV that I want people to look at and decide on how my IT skill will please other work place. 
I am a hard working teammate to be around with, so if any needs the chance to be spoked to than it will be used properly  in the work place. I can also do more for others personally.
